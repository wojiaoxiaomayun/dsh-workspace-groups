/**
 * Pure session-tab state: the ordered strip of sessions the user has opened,
 * the active one, and each tab's derived presentation.
 *
 * Position model: a tab's place in the strip is decided ONCE, when it is first
 * opened, and never changes afterwards. Switching to a tab, or re-opening a
 * session that already has one, leaves the strip exactly as it was — so clicking
 * a chip never moves the chip out from under the pointer. Only two events change
 * the order: a session opening for the FIRST time (append) and a tab closing
 * (remove).
 *
 * Runtime-free on purpose (same discipline as `store-core.ts` / `quick.ts`):
 * the component owns the ref + React state, this module owns every rule, and
 * unit tests exercise the real semantics without a browser module loader.
 *
 * Retention note: a tab outlives whatever it points at. The strip is a list of
 * things the USER opened, so nothing here consults the session catalog — a tab
 * whose session is gone stays visible until the user closes it, and no
 * background sweep ever trims the strip.

 * Whether the open session must surface a tab.
 *
 * A tab means "this conversation is in play right now", not "I once opened
 * this". Browsing history is what the sidebar is for; opening an old
 * conversation to read it should not litter the strip, which is the whole point
 * of the strip being a working set rather than a second session list.
 *
 * A session therefore earns a tab only once a conversation has actually STARTED
 * in it and is still engaged, which is any of:
 * - **running** — the agent is producing output (including subagents);
 * - **waiting on you** — an approval / plan review / question is pending;
 * - **unseen completion** — it finished while you were elsewhere, so the tab is
 *   the thing that tells you to come back.
 *
 * A still-blank draft gets NO tab: the tab appears the moment the first message
 * is sent (which is when the controller flips `blank` on `turn/start`). Once the
 * turn ends and you have read the result, the session is settled history and
 * does not earn a tab — so clicking through finished conversations leaves the
 * strip alone. Tabs already opened stay open: this gate only decides whether a
 * NEW tab appears, never whether an existing one closes.
 *
 * `blank` (from `sessionListMetadata`) is exactly "no turn has started": the
 * controller flips it to false on `turn/start`. It is the right signal for
 * "has this conversation begun", and the wrong one ALONE — a conversation
 * finished a week ago is also non-blank, which is why the earlier `!blank` rule
 * surfaced every old conversation the user clicked.

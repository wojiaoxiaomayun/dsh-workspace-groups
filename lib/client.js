		* DOM seat for the session tab strip.
		*
		* Why this exists instead of a slot: the strip belongs at the very top of the
		* conversation column — `pI_x6G_centerCol` (ui-layout's AppFrame `.centerCol`,
		* a hashed CSS-Modules class). That column declares NO child slots: its only
		* child is the `main` slot's occupant (`renderSlot('main', …)`, the
		* Conversation or a global panel), so there is nowhere to register. The
		* shipped slot in that neighbourhood — `conversation.composer.dock` — is the
		* band UNDER the composer card, a different place entirely.
		*
		* So the strip gets a real DOM seat: this module finds the column, prepends a
		* `<div>` to it, and hands that element to a React portal. The element is
		* OURS, never React's: it is inserted outside the column's child list that
		* React reconciles, and it is re-inserted if React (or a theme/titlebar
		* re-render) ever drops it.
		*
		* Two hazards this module is built around:
		*
		* 1. `centerCol` is a hashed class name (`pI_x6G_centerCol`) that changes when
		*    the package is rebuilt. Matching is therefore done on the *structural*
		*    contract — a grid-item column that holds the `main` panel — plus a
		*    `[class*="_centerCol"]` probe, never on the exact hash.
		* 2. The column mounts after the client plugin's `apply()` runs. Discovery is
		*    therefore a MutationObserver on `document.body` plus a `requestAnimationFrame`
		*    retry, and both are torn down when the owning effect disposes.

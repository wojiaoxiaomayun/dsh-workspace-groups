/**
 * The session-tab store: the `defineStore` binding and nothing else.
 *
 * The action TRANSFORMS live in `tabs.ts` (pure, runtime-free), so unit tests
 * exercise the real semantics without pulling in the store engine — this module
 * is the only place that needs `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-store`, and importing it
 * from a test would drag `zustand` into the test process.
 *
 * One handle, one scope: the tab store is seated by the `sidebar.workspaces`
 * entry alone. The tab strip is a CHILD of that entry (rendered through a DOM
 * portal into the conversation column), not a second slot registration, so the
 * handle is never mounted under a second, differently-scoped slot — which the
 * registry rejects outright ("one handle, one scope").
 *
 * Placement is navigation, not data: the strip derives its active chip from the
 * open session, and arrival order is the strip's only order, so nothing here
 * mirrors selection.

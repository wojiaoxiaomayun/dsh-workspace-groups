/**
 * The "flower branch" geometry for the sidebar tree.
 *
 * Reproduces the RewampUI *Flower Sidebar* mechanism: a single curly branch runs
 * down the left of the nav list, drawn as SVG so it can be *grown* — a faded
 * dashed ghost shows the whole route, and a solid stroke is drawn only as far as
 * the row you are on. Each row gets a dot sitting exactly on the curve, and the
 * active row's dot blooms.
 *
 * How it maps onto OUR tree (three levels: 分组 folder → 项目 folder → 会话 row):
 *
 *   - The branch is **one continuous path** through every visible row, not one
 *     rail per folder. That is what makes it read as a plant rather than as the
 *     per-folder rail it replaces.
 *   - The stem runs at `STEM_X`; at each **group boundary** it kinks outward to
 *     `BULGE_X` and back — a half-pitch out plus a half-pitch back, which is
 *     exactly the reference's 32px rhythm.
 *   - Rows that are not group boundaries sit on a straight run, one row pitch
 *     apart, each carrying a dot at its own y.
 *
 * Runtime-free on purpose (same discipline as `tabs.ts` / `store-core.ts`): the
 * component measures the DOM and hands plain numbers here, so the geometry is
 * unit-testable without a browser.

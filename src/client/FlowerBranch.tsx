/**
 * The flower branch: an SVG overlay that draws one continuous curly stem down
 * the sidebar tree, growing to the row you are currently on.
 *
 * Ported from the RewampUI *Flower Sidebar* reference. The mechanism, verified
 * against that page's live DOM:
 *
 *   - TWO paths share one `d` prefix: a **ghost** (dashed, faded) drawing the
 *     whole route, and a **grown** solid stroke drawn only as far as the active
 *     row. The grown one is what makes the branch look like it grew to you.
 *   - A **dot per row**, sitting exactly on the curve.
 *   - A **flower at the endpoint**: the stem grows into a bloom on the row you
 *     are on, which is where the grown stroke stops. The bloom TURNS while that
 *     session is working and rests when it is idle.
 *   - The whole SVG is `pointer-events: none` and `overflow: visible`, so it is
 *     pure decoration over the real rows and never intercepts a click.
 *
 * Measurement, not layout: the rows are rendered by the tree itself (they carry
 * drag handlers, menus and hover state), so this component reads each row's
 * vertical centre from the DOM and feeds plain numbers to `buildBranch`. That
 * keeps the geometry unit-tested (`branch.ts`) while the SVG stays a dumb
 * renderer of it.
 *
 * Re-measured on: row count changes (expand/collapse, new session), the active
 * row changing, and container resize. A `ResizeObserver` on the scroll body
 * covers the last one without a window listener.
 *
 * The bloom's spin is NOT re-measured here: it arrives as the `spinning` prop
 * and is applied as a class, so a status flip never re-runs the DOM measurement
 * above (the tree is the expensive part, not the class swap).

 *      the grown stroke).
 *   2. `scale(FLOWER_SCALE)` — shrink the 1024-unit artwork about that origin.
 *   3. `translate(-512 -512)` — bring the glyph's own centre (512, 512) onto the
 *      origin, so the flower is centred on the tip.
 *
 * The spin is applied by `wgFlowerArt` in CSS as a `rotate()` composed AFTER
 * that recentring (`translate(-512 -512) rotate(...)`), so the bloom turns about
 * its own centre and the recentring never drifts as it rotates.
 *
 * Note what is deliberately NOT used here: a percentage `translate(-50%, -50%)`
 * or `transform-box: fill-box` + percentage `transform-origin`. Measured on the
 * live page, the percentage form resolved against the SVG VIEWPORT rather than
 * the path's box, translating by (-24, -409.5) instead of (-373, -409.6) and
 * parking the bloom well right of the stem. Explicit user units remove the
 * question: 512 is the measured centre, not an inferred one.
 *
 * The flower rests while the session is idle and turns while it works: one
 * animation, paused rather than removed, so a state flip resumes the turn
 * instead of snapping the petals back to 0deg.
 *
